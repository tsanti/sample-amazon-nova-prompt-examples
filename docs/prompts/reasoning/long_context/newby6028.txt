CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND ORDER
RE FINAL APPROVAL OF PLAN OF ALLOCATION
Pending before the Court in the above referenced cause
is Lead Plaintiff the Regents of the University of California’s
motion for final approval of the proposed Plan of Allocation of
the settlement proceeds (instrument #5793).1  A Fairness Hearing


5897, 5898, 5899, 5900, 5919, 5921, 5934, 5936, 5948, 5951, and

various parties at the Fairness Hearing on February 29, 2008,
including presentation of, and objections to, the Plan of
Allocation.

I.  Conclusions of Law
A.  Jurisdiction
The 
Court 
has 
federal 
question 
subject 
matter
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 over this dispute arising out
of violations of the federal securities laws, in particular §§
10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§
78j(b), 78t(a), and 78t-1, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,
17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and §§ 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the


- 3 -
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k, 77l(a)(2), and 77o.
This Court also has jurisdiction under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”) pursuant to § 22 of the
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77v, and § 27 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa.
As for personal jurisdiction over the absent plaintiff
class members, in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797
(1985), the Supreme Court noted the distinction between an out-of-
state defendant haled into a foreign court to defend or suffer a
default judgment and an absent class-action plaintiff who may lack
all minimum contacts with the forum state and cited its earlier
opinion in Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40-41 (1940):
[A] “class” or “representative” suit was an
exception to the rule that one could not be
bound by a judgment in personam unless one
was made fully a party in the traditional
sense. . . . As the Court pointed out in
Hansberry, the class action was an invention
of equity to enable it to proceed to a decree
in suits where the number of those interested
in the litigation was too great to permit
joinder.  The absent parties would be bound
by the decree so long as the named parties
adequately represented the absent class and
the prosecution of the litigation was within
the common interest.
Shutts, 472 U.S. at 808.  Thus “a forum State may exercise
jurisdiction over the claim of an absent class-action plaintiff,
even though the plaintiff may not possess the minimum contacts


- 4 -
with the forum which would support personal jurisdiction over a
defendant.”  Id. at 811.  Nevertheless, 
[i]f the forum State wishes to bind an absent
plaintiff concerning a claim for money
damages or similar relief at law, it must
provide 
minimal 
procedural 
due 
process
protection.  The plaintiff must receive
notice plus an opportunity to be heard and
participate in the litigation, whether in
person or through counsel.  The notice must
be 
the 
best 
practicable, 
“reasonably
calculated 
under 
all 
circumstances, 
to
apprise interested parties of the pendency of
th action and afford them an opportunity to
present their objections. . . . The notice
should 
describe 
the 
action 
and 
the
plaintiffs’ rights in it.  Additionally, we
hold that due process requires at a minimum
that an absent plaintiff be provided with an
opportunity to remove himself from the class
by executing and returning an “opt out” or
“request for exclusion” form to the court.
Finally, the Due Process Clause of course
requires that the named plaintiff at all
times adequately represent the interests of
the absent class members.
Id. at 811-12 [citations omitted]; see also Silber V. Mabon, 18
F.3d 1449, 1453-54 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1994)(applying Shutts in
securities class action).  
B. Standard of Review
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) and
(2), regarding a proposed settlement, “The court must direct
notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be
bound by the proposal. . . . If the proposal would bind class
members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on


     3 Quoting Cohen v. Resolution Trust Corp., 61 F.3d 725, 728
(9th Cir. 1995), vacated on other grounds, 72 F.3d 686 (9th Cir.
1996).
- 5 -
finding that it is fair, reasonable and adequate.”  See also
Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1339 (5th Cir. 1977)(“In
determining whether to approve a proposed settlement, the cardinal
rule is that the District Court must find that the settlement is
fair, adequate and reasonable and is not the product of collusion
between the parties.”).  The same standard of review “applies with
as much force to the review of the allocation agreement as it does
to the review of the overall settlement between plaintiffs and
defendants.”  In re Chicken Antitrust Litig., 669 F.2d 228, 238
(5th Cir. 1982), quoted for the same proposition, Schwartz v. TXU
Corp., No. 3:02-CV-2243-K, 2005 WL 3148350, *23 (N.D. Tex. Nov.
8, 2005); In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig., 194
F.R.D. 166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000)(same).  Generally courts will find
“reasonable” a plan of distribution that reimburses class members
based on the type and extent of their damages.  In re Ikon, 194
F.R.D. at 184.  Nevertheless, “‘a class action settlement need not
necessarily treat all class members equally.’”  Schwartz v. TSU
Corp., No. 3:02-CV-2243-K, et al., 2005 WL 3148350, *23 (N.D. Tex.
Nov. 8, 2005)3, citing inter alia Petruzzi’s, Inc. v. Darling-
Delaware Co., 880 F. Supp. 292, 300-01 (M.D. Pa. 1995)(“disparate
treatment of class members may be justified by a demonstration


     4 Schwartz, 2005 WL 3148350, at *23, also cites In re
Microstrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 148 F. Supp. 2d 654, 669 (E.D. Va.
2001)(approving plan of allocation that “sensibly makes interclass
distinctions based upon, inter alia, the relative strengths and
weaknesses of class members’ individual claims and the timing of
the purchases of the securities at issue”); In re Aetna Sec.
Litig., No. CIV. A. MDL 1219, 2001 WL 20928, *12 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4,
2001)(approving plan of allocation that “acknowledges the differing
losses suffered by Claimants depending on the dates on which they
purchased and sold Aetna stock and the price at which they may have
sold the shares”).

that the favored class members have different claims or greater
damages”).4  Deciding the fairness of a settlement is within the
sound discretion of the trial court, whose determination will not
be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse of that discretion.
Chicken, 669 F.2d at 238.  
Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit has opined, “In addition,
our judgment is informed by the strong judicial policy favoring
settlements as well as the realization that compromise is the
essence of settlement.  As we have said elsewhere, a ‘just result
is often no more than an arbitrary point between competing notions
of reasonableness.’”  Id., citing In re Corrugated Container
Antitrust Litigation, 659 F.2d 1332, 1325 (5th Cir. 1981).  Lead
Plaintiff emphasizes, through its expert Professor Roman Weil,
there is no single, unique, fair, reasonable and adequate Plan of
Allocation. 
C.  Notice to Class Members


- 7 -
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) requires for
classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3) “the best notice practicable
under the circumstances, including individual notice to all
members who can be identified through reasonable effort.”  Rule
23(e)(1) mandates, “The court must direct notice in a reasonable
manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.”
The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution also
imposes minimum notice requirements, which are met if the notice
satisfies Rule 23(c)(2).  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S.
156, 173-74 (1974)(for due process, notice in a class action must
provide a fair recital of the subject matter and of the proposed
terms and must give the class an opportunity to be heard); In re
Nissan Motor Corp. Antitrust Litig., 552 F.2d 1088, 1097 (5th Cir.
1977); Miller v. Republic Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 559 F.2d 426, 429-
30 (5th Cir. 1977).  Generally the notice requirements of Federal
R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) may be met by a combination of individual
notice to identifiable class members and notice by publication.
6A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 12:312 (and cases cited therein).  
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the notice
in a class action settlement must inform class members of “(i) the
nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified;
(iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class
member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member


     5 Under Article 581-33(a)(1) of the Texas Securities Act,
rescission is the remedy if the purchaser still owns the securities
or damages if he no longer does.  Citizens Ins. Co. of America v.
- 8 -
so desires; (v) that the court will exclude from the class any
member who requests exclusion; (vi) the time and manner for
requesting exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect of a class
judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).”
In addition, the notice must also be provided timely,
allowing a sufficient period for the class members to respond,
make any objections, and prepare for the Fairness Hearing.  See,
e.g., Miller, 559 F.2d at 429 (finding a period of four weeks
between the mailing of the notice and the hearing to be
sufficient).  Notice is “adequate if it may be understood by the
average class member.  4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg
on Class Actions § 11:53 at 167 (4th ed. 2002).
II.  Findings of Fact
A.  Plan of Allocation
A substantial difficulty, unusual if not unique, in
drafting a plan of allocation that was fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all class members in the Newby litigation was the wide
variety 
of 
securities 
involved; 
the 
settlements 
covered
approximately 195 different Enron or Enron-related securities.
Furthermore, there were claims under §§ 10(b), 11 and the Texas
Securities Act, each with a different measure of damages.5


Hakim Deccach, 217 S.W.3d 430, 436 n.1 (Tex. 2007).  Section 11
damages are limited by statute, 15 U.S.C. § 77k (plaintiff may
recover “the difference between the amount paid for the security)
not exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the
public)” and (i) the value at the time the case was brought, or
(ii) the price at which the security was sold before the case was
brought, or (iii) the price at which the security was sold after
the case was brought if that generates damages of less than the
difference between the price paid (limited to the offering price)
and the value on the date the case was brought.  Section 10(b)
prevailing securities investors recover inflation-adjusted losses.
Pursuant to case law, since the statute does not establish a
means of measuring damages, Professor Weil explains that the Plan
measures § 10(b) losses based on inflation, by using a value line,
a standard method of measuring class damages, and the Court refers
the parties to that discussion rather than repeating it here.  See
#5794 at 8-10.  After reviewing the whole Plan of Allocation,
Professor Weil concluded that the Plan is fair, reasonable and
adequate.  Id. at 10.
- 9 -
The Court finds that the settlement Notice, in clear
language easily understandable by a layman, defined the class,
apprised the potential class members of the terms of the
settlement, the proposed plan of allocation and their options,
their right to participate in the cash distribution by filing a
timely and valid Proof of Claim form, and their right to object
and to be heard at the Fairness Hearing on February 29, 2008.
Notice was timely given, approximately two months prior to the
Fairness Hearing.
Pursuant to Stipulations of Settlement, the settlement
fund recovered from nine partial settlements and resolution of the
LJM2 bankruptcy claim amounts to $7,227,390,000, plus interest,


     6 The Notice at VII informs class members of the amounts of
money and percentages Lead Counsel and class representatives are
seeking as fees and expenses. The Court addresses the issues of
Lead Counsel’s fee award and of class representatives’ expenses in
separate orders.
     7 All the definitions of terms used in the Plan are found at
#5900, Ex. A, Notice at § III.
     8 Lead Counsel states it received assistance from Stanford
Consulting (a damages consultant), Chris Patti (University Counsel
for the Regents), consultants Robert Fairbank and Rock Hanken,
hired by the Regents, and Professor Roman Weil, in preparing the
Plan of Allocation.  #5897 at 10-11, ¶¶ 37, 40, 42.

and minus notice and administration  expenses, Lead Counsel’s fees
and expenses, and various plaintiffs’ costs and expenses.  
Under the proposed Plan of Allocation, the settlement
fund, net of expenses and the fee award,6 would be distributed to
“Eligible Claimants,” as defined in the Plan,7 on the basis of
their individual claims.  See Corrected Order Approving Form and
Manner of Notice, #5789, Ex. A, § V.A.; also found at Declaration
of Carole K. Sylvester, #5900, Ex. A, “Notice,” § V. A.  The
proposed Plan of Allocation is described in the Notice mailed on
December 21, 2007 to all persons and their beneficiaries who
purchased or acquired any Enron securities or Enron-related
securities by any method from September 9, 1997 to December 2,
2001.  Id. at § V and Declaration of Carole K. Sylvester, #5900
at 2.  The proposed Plan was drafted by Lead Counsel and Lead
Plaintiff, aided by their damage consultants and others,8 and with
consultation with other attorneys in this litigation, for


     9 Category 1 securities include Enron common stock, Enron debt
(Notes), Enron preferred securities, put and call options on Enron
common stock, and derivatives known as the “Foreign Debt
Securities.”
- 11 -
distribution of the settlement fund to investors who suffered
losses resulting from the alleged Enron fraud and to pay for the
expense of the litigation.  The proposed Plan was first published
in July 2007 for public comment, available on the web site
www.enronfraud.com.  After receiving and reviewing public comments
and further discussions with its consultants, Lead Plaintiff made
adjustments to the Plan.  Subsequently in negotiating with
objectors, other changes were made.
Lead Counsel divided the eligible securities, listed in
exhibits 1 and 3 to the Notice, into two groups.  #5756 at 3-4;
Notice at V.B. (#5900 Ex. A).  
The first group (“Category 1") were securities issued
by Enron, some of its predecessor firms (Internorth or Houston
Natural Gas) or trusts, or other entities created by Enron for the
purpose of issuing a particular security, or were derivatives of
those securities.9  Id.  Their price or value during the Eligible
Period (September 9, 1997 through December 2, 2001, inclusive) was
mainly dependent on Enron’s credit, financial condition or ability
to pay, and disclosure of alleged fraud at Enron had to cause
movement in the price of these securities.  Id. at 4.  This group
were the main focus of the Newby litigation and therefore the Plan


     10 Lead Plaintiff’s expert, Professor Ramon Weill, explains
that Category 1 is composed of securities which the Newby complaint
asserted, while Category 2 is composed of “securities that the
settling defendants added to the set of securities subject to the
settlements.”  #5794 at 6.
     11 The Plan makes clear that in accordance with federal
securities law, “The market price (or value, if market prices are
- 12 -
of Allocation is structured to distribute about 95% of the
proceeds to them.  Id.  
The second group, “Category 2,”10 were composed of
securities issued by Enron-related entities, including equity,
debt, preferred securities and derivatives of those securities.
Disclosure of the alleged fraud at Enron did not affect the prices
of some of them (listed in Exhibit 2), and the plan of allocation
therefore excludes those from participation in the settlement
funds.  Other Category 2 securities’ prices were affected by the
disclosures; thus purchasers and acquirers of those securities,
listed in exhibit 1, which is not necessarily exhaustive, do share
in the distribution.  Still other Category 2 securities, listed
in exhibit 3, are classified in an “unknown” category because
pricing data for them was not available despite great efforts by
Lead Counsel and its damages expert to obtain them.  Thus these
may share in the distribution, but only if the claimant presents
adequate evidence of both the price or value of the security and
of a decline in that the price or value caused by disclosure of
alleged fraud at Enron.11  Furthermore, because the claims for


not available) of the Enron or Enron-Related Security, must have
declined due to disclosure of the alleged Enron fraud.”  #5900,
Notice, § V.C.(g).
- 13 -
eligible Category 2 securities were determined by Lead Counsel to
be “weaker” than the Category 1 claims, the plan of allocation
limits distribution to them to 5% of the settlement proceeds.  Id.
Lead Plaintiff adequately explains that in an effort to
be fair to all eligible claimants, for at least two reasons it
commingled the settlement funds into a single pool, rather than
allocating them into different pools with distribution dependent
on the particular claims (§ 10(b) or § 11) asserted against a
particular defendant.  First, even when a settlement was achieved
against a particular defendant at a time when only one type of
claim was pending against it, e.g., a § 11 claim, having different
pools would not have recognized that in certain circumstances,
other claims, e.g., § 10(b) claims, had been asserted against that
same defendant but had been dismissed, leaving appellate exposure
against that defendant.  Second, if a specific amount was
allocated to cover only a particular security and the number of
claims made based on that security was significantly lower than
that for other eligible securities, a windfall would result for
those claimants.  Because the Regents observed that certain § 11
claims drove certain settlements with certain defendants, the
Regents, with the aid of its economic/damage expert, created


     12 For example, purchasers of Enron’s 7% Notes, which had both
§ 10(b) and § 11 claims, that have a “Recognized Claim” are
entitled to the greater of the § 10(b) measure of loss or three
times the § 11 measure of loss and they share in total settlements,
including the $6.5 billion generated through the settlements of §
10(b) claims.  See #5764.  See also #5900, Notice, D3 regarding
multipliers for § 11 claimants.
     13 Under the Plan, V.C.1.(a), a ”’Recognized Loss’ is the
amount of a claim under this Plan before the application of any
- 14 -
“multipliers” to put those claimants in the same economic position
they would have been in if separate pools of money had been
allocated for various section 11 claims and another for the §
10(b) claims.12  Last of all, formulae for calculated claims were
derived from the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 reports that
were prepared by the Regents’ economic/damage experts, whose
damage theories Lead Plaintiff would have presented at trial; in
other words the formulae reflected Lead Counsel’s determination
of what the damages to class members were and what Lead Counsel
thought it could prove at trial. 
Under the Plan, “Eligible Claimants,” defined in the
Plan (Notice at § V.A.1 and 2), who submit valid and timely Proof
of Claim forms, under the circumstances identified in Notice §§
V-VI, will receive cash distributions from the net balance of the
settlement fund.  The Plan treats all Eligible Claimants
similarly, so everyone entitled to a distribution who submits a
valid and timely claim will receive a pro rata share of the Net
Settlement Fund in the proportion that his “Recognized Claim”13


multiplier.”  Under V.C.1.(b), a “‘Recognized Claim’ is the amount
of a claim under this Plan after the application of a multiplier,
or, if no multiplier is applied, remains equal to the Recognized
Loss.”
- 15 -
bears to the total of all Recognized Claims.  As Professor Weil
declares, “In general each Authorized Claimant will receive an
amount determined by multiplying the net settlement fund by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the authorized claimant’s
Recognized Claim and the denominator of which is the total
Recognized Claims of all Authorized Claimants.”  #5794 at 7-8.
Lead Counsel estimates that there are more than a million class
members 
who 
may 
submit 
claims 
and 
subsequently 
receive
distributions of the settlement funds.  #5794 at 5, ¶ 20.
The Court finds that the Plan of Allocation was
negotiated at arm’s length, with no evidence, nor allegations, of
collusion, and that the allocation is fair, reasonable and
adequate as to Class Members.  The Court further finds that
methodology used by Lead Counsel took into consideration the
unique facts and circumstances of this litigation, interclass
distinctions based on the relative strength and weaknesses of the
different claims, the timing of purchases and sales, the magnitude
of the loss, and the different kinds of recovery available under
the different statutes, in producing a fair, adequate and
reasonable plan for distribution of the funds.  The Court notes
that the Plan Allocation has also been found to be fair, adequate,


- 16 -
and reasonable by expert Professor Ramon Weil, after careful
examination of its underlying facts and principles.  #5795 at 6-10
The Court finds that Lead Plaintiff has given the best
notice practicable under the circumstances and has fully satisfied
all applicable notice requirements, including the United States
Constitution, Rule 23(e) and Rule 23(c)(2)’s requirement of
individual notice “to all members who can be identified through
reasonable effort.”  Reasonable Notice of the Plan of Allocation
and opportunity to opt out were provided to in-state and out-of-
state Class Members in this action, pursuant to this Court’s
order.  Court’s Corrected Order Approving Form and Manner of
Notice (#5789)(with Notice, Ex. 1, and Proof of Claim Form, Ex.
2, attached)(finding the Notice “constitutes the best notice
practicable under the circumstances” to notify class members of
this action, their right to object to the Plan, the award of
attorneys’ fees, and the award of expenses to be paid to Lead
Plaintiff and class representatives).  Claims Administrator
Gilardi & Co. mailed the Notice and Proof of Claim form by first-
class mail, postage prepaid, to all Eligible Claimants that could
be identified by Lead Plaintiffs’ counsel with reasonable effort
at each claimant’s last known address.  Id.; Declaration of Carole
K. Sylvester (of Gilardi & Co., LLC)(regarding the mailing of the
Notice), #5900.  Furthermore the Court’s order directed banks,


- 17 -
brokerage firms, institutions, and other persons (“nominees”) who
purchased Eligible Securities for the beneficial owners of those
securities, within ten calendar days of receiving the Notice,
either (a) to send the Notice to the beneficial owners, or (b) if
they had not already done so with prior settlements, to send a
list containing the names and addresses of the beneficial owners
to the Claims Administrator, which in turn promptly mailed Notice
to the beneficial owners.  Id.  The Claims Administrator mailed
1,262,301 claim packets to potential class members on December 21,
2007, 81 more claim packages on January 2, 2008 to entities
holding securities for the benefit of class member customers, and,
in response to correspondence or inquiries from potential class
members, 328,051 more.  #5900 at 2.  Notice by publication, twice
in Investor’s Business Daily on December 26 and 27, 2007 and twice
in the Houston Chronicle on the same dates, was also effected
pursuant to the Court’s Order.  #5789 and 5900.  Lead Counsel and
the Claims Administrator also published the Notice and Proof of
Claim form on the Internet, with a clear explanation of the
Fairness Hearing set before this Court on February 29, 2008:
http://www.enronfraud.com/enr-cgi-bin/mil?templ=settlement.html
and http://www.gilardi.com/enron/securities/.  That Fairness
Hearing took place as scheduled.
B.  Objections


     14 See Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir.
1977)(“Particularly in class action suits, there is an overriding
public interest in favor of settlement.”).
- 18 -
Lead Plaintiff observes that although the class members’
losses are approximately $44 billion, the settlement fund is
composed of limited dollars (approximately $7.2 billion) for which
there are competing claimants; there are more than one million
class members who may make claims and receive distributions.
Inevitably some will complain that the Plan of Allocation is
unfair to them.  If changes are made to the current Plan in
response to objections, some claimants will receive more and
others less.  Lead Plaintiff urges, “While the Plan may not
satisfy every potential claimant, that does not mean that it is
unfair.  To the contrary, the Plan is the product of serious
informed choices, is fair, reasonable and adequate and should be
finally approved.”  #5892 at 3.  This Court agrees.  Moreover, in
addition to the strong policy favoring settlement in class action
suits,14 the Court notes that had the partial settlements in this
litigation not been achieved when they were, under the Supreme
Court’s recent ruling in Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 761 (2008), most of the
recovery fund based on § 10(b) claims would likely not have been
obtained by Newby plaintiffs.
1.  Resolved Objections


- 19 -
Objections filed by several class members have been
resolved:  (1) the J. Corman Family Limited Partnership # 3, which
objected (#5859)to the inflation percentage (76%) attributed to
Enron “bond-like” preferred stock, compared with that (94%) for
common stock and “stock-like” preferred, was resolved when Lead
Counsel agreed to modify the plan of allocation (#5936 at 1); (2)
the Ruben Parties, who complained that the Plan discriminates
against Eligible Claimants who “acquired” rather than purchased
Eligible Securities (#5861, 5860, 5919) was resolved and withdrawn
(#5934, 5936 at 1); (3) Nathaniel Pulsifer as Trustee of the
Shooter’s Hill Revocable Trust (#5764, 5783); and (4) Brian
Dabrowski (#5759, 5783).
2.  Pending Objections
a.  Stanley Majors (#5840) complains that the cut-off date of the
Eligible Period for reimbursement, December 2, 2001 is too early
because he purchased his Enron stock after Enron was in
bankruptcy, beginning in January, 2003, at less that eight cents
per share.
As Lead Plaintiff responds, the Regents never included
2002 and 2003 in their complaint nor asserted any basis to do so.
Moreover, Mr. Majors concedes that he purchased the stock in 2003
“when ENRON was in bankruptcy and ‘fraud’ was not told to me when
I purchased my stocks,” but that he did so because “[i]t still


     15 Joined by Nasser Pebdani (#5877).
- 20 -
looked to me Enron would come out of bankruptcy and be a viable
company once again.”  His investment decision was not based on the
same facts and circumstances as those asserted on behalf of the
class in the Newby complaint.  
The Court agrees with Lead Plaintiff and overrules Mr.
Majors’ objection.  
b.  Larry Fenstad and Dorothy Lancaster McCoppin15 (#5868) complain
that (1) the Notice and Proof of Claim form are confusing; (2)
there is no timetable for the Claims Administrator (Gilardi & Co.)
to resolve claims; (3) the Court should require reports about the
status of distribution from Claims Administrator every 90 days;
(4) should have an appeals process; (5) the deadline for filing
claims should be extended; (6) additional instructions from
Administrator should be given to all class members; and (7) the
claims deadline should be extended.
 The Court finds these objections should be overruled.
When this Court approved the form and matter of the Notice and
Proof of Claim Form (#5789) prior to its being mailed to potential
class members, the Court had already found that the Notice, along
with the Proof of Claim form, while addressing a complex matter,
is clear, understandable by laymen, and adequately informative.
If they were confused, the Plan referred then to two web sites,


- 21 -
www.gilardi.com or www.enronfraud.com and stated they could write
to Lead Counsel about any questions regarding the Plan of
Allocation.  Notice at § X.  In addition, two open meetings were
held on March 27 and 29, 2008 in Houston, Texas for Enron class
members, and representatives of Lead Counsel and of the Claims
Administrator were present to answer individual questions
regarding the Plan of Allocation and the Proof of Claim Form.
These objectors have not indicated if they utilized any of these
opportunities to express their questions.  Lead Counsel has shown
that Gilardi & Co. is an experienced and reliable claims
administrator that has administered claims in hundreds of other
securities class actions.  See www.gilardi.com.  See also #5892
at 5; Declaration of Dennis A. Gilardi (# 5899)(“During the past
25 years, Gilardi has provided notice and administration services
in more than 2,500 class actions.”).  Its personnel answer
telephone calls, email, and regular mail inquiries from claimants.
#5899 at 3.  They provide individual review of claims, provide
information about any deficiencies in the claims or documentation
necessary to support them, and help each claimant throughout the
process to cure any deficiency where possible.  Id. at 4-5
(“Gilardi views its role in the deficiency and cure process as
that of a facilitator, and never as an adversary.”).  Furthermore
there is an appeals process in the Plan:  if the Claims


- 22 -
Administrator 
rejects 
the 
claimant’s 
claim, 
the 
Claims
Administrator will send a rejection letter advising the claimant
of his rights and the reasons for the rejection, and the claimant
may request an administrative review and/or has recourse to turn
to the Court and ask it to review his claim.  Id. at 4-6; #5900,
Notice, Ex. A, § V.E.(5)(“The Court reserves jurisdiction to
modify, amend, or alter the Plan of Allocation without further
notice or to allow or disallow or adjust any Authorized Claimant’s
claim, to ensure fair and equitable distribution of funds.”).  As
for any time limits, Gilardi is “committed to an efficient and
timely distribution of the Fund”.  #5899 at 6.  As noted by Lead
Counsel, there are a number of factors beyond Gilardi’s control:
whether the Plan of Allocation approved by the Court is appealed;
how complete, accurate and properly supported by documentation the
submitted claims are; how many Eligible Claimants will require
assistance from Gilardi and Lead Counsel; and how many will
request a Court review of Gilardi’s determination.  As for any
delays in claimants’ obtaining the necessary documentation to
support their claims, the Court has authorized Lead Counsel, “in
their discretion, [to] accept for processing late claims so long
as the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund to Authorized
Claimants is not materially delayed thereby.  The Court finds


- 23 -
unnecessary periodic reports from the Claims Administrator and
periodic or delayed payments for its services.
Mr. Fenstad and Ms. McCoppin also request the Court to
provide them with “a reasonable incentive award” for their
services as class representatives and objectors.  As this Court
has indicated in #5996, such incentive awards are contrary to the
policy behind the PSLRA.  Thus the Court denies the request.
c.  Jeanette Dreisbach (#5873) complains that shareholders will
only receive a distribution of $6.79 per share of common stock,
especially in view of the settlement recovery of $7.227 billion.
She asks the Court to “[a]llow individual investors/shareholders
to recover full amount of loss then whatever amount remains in the
Allocation Fund be split fairly among the other plaintiffs who
were acting as money managers for other people’s money and did not
suffer personal loss.”  
While the “money managers” may not personally have lost
money, their clients or plan participants surely did.  The
institutional investors deserve a fair allocation of the
settlement funds as much as the individual investors do.  Ms.
Dreisbach’s objection is overruled.  


     
16 Silvercreek Management, Inc., Silvercreek Limited
Partnership, Silvercreek II Limited, OIP Limited and Pebble Limited
Partnership.
     17 Originally the Silvercreek Plaintiffs joined in the
Opposition of Nathaniel Pulsifer as Trustee of Shooter’s Hill
Revocable Trust (#5764), investors in Enron 7% Exchangeable Notes,
arguing that the Plan failed to segregate the funds from the
section 11 claims from the funds from the section 10(b) claims.
After Pulsifer and Lead Plaintiff resolved Pulsifer’s objection by
adjusting the Plan by increasing the size of the multiplier for the
7% Exchangeable Notes, Silvercreek filed its own objection.  
     18 Specifically they contend that the funds from the “pure §
11 settlements” (with Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, and the
Outside Directors) are improperly commingled with the remaining
Enron settlements, which included settlement by parties who were
liable to all Enron stakeholders, and not just to investors in
certain specific Enron Securities.
     19 Bank of America, Outside Directors, and Lehman Brothers.
- 24 -
d.  Silvercreek Plaintiffs16 (#5874)17 object that the plan, with
its single pool, improperly intermingles funds from different
settlements18 and thereby unfairly dilutes the recovery of class
member owners of the  7%, 7.375%, 7.875%, and Zero Coupon Notes,
whose claims arise exclusively or predominately under Section 11,
in favor of open market securities, whose claims are predicated
solely or predominately on Section 10(b).  Because the section 11
defendants19 settled claims arising under only that statute,
Silvercreek Plaintiffs contend that there is no basis to require
the settlement consideration paid by them to be distributed to
other class members who have no claim against these defendants.
Rather than using multipliers and a single pool, the Silvercreek


     20 The Silvercreek Plaintiffs’ objections (that access to the
settlement funds from section 11 claims should be limited to
section 11 claimants) were previously raised by Nathaniel Pulsifer,
as Trustee of the Shooter’s Hill Revocable Trust, with regard to
the preliminary approval of the Plan of Allocation.
- 25 -
Plaintiffs want separate pools of funds established for the
section 11 claimants and a single pool for all the rest.
Lead Plaintiff urges the Court to overrule the
Silvercreek Plaintiffs’ objection that the claims of class members
with § 11 claims are being diminished in favor of class members
with § 10(b) claims.  It first insists that monies obtained in
settlement of the 7% Note claims were obtained in exchange for
extinguishment of both § 11 and § 10(b) claims, and thus should
not be segregated from other § 10(b) claims.  See Lead Plaintiff’s
Response to Nathaniel Pulsifer’s Opposition,20 #5774 at 1.  For
example, even though the § 10(b) claims against it had been
dismissed, the Bank of America demanded, and was accorded, as a
condition of the settlement a broad definition of the settlement
class and releases of § 10(b) claims relating to many Enron or
Enron-related securities.
Second, 
Lead 
Counsel 
argues 
against 
Silvercreek
Plaintiffs, establishing separate pools of funds for § 11
purchasers could result in disparate recoveries among claimants
because of disparate claim rates.  Supplemental Declaration of its
Plan expert, Professor Roman L. Weil (#5898).  Professor Ramon


- 26 -
Weil explains that such an allocation could result unfairly in
“eventual outcomes to participants that could be so disparate as
to violate the principle underlying the Plan that all authorized
claimants be treated in a way so as to nullify the effect of
differential claims rates.”  See Weil Supplemental Declaration
(#5898 at 1), citing Weil Declaration (#5794) at ¶ 23(h).  Exhibit
1 to #5898, asserts Professor Weil, shows how reasonably different
claims rates could lead to disparate recovery rates, exactly what
Lead Plaintiff has tried to avoid.  Instead, under the Plan, he
maintains, if the claims rates turn out to be the same across
classes of claims, with the use of multipliers the § 11 securities
will receive the amounts they would have gotten if there had been
separate pools, as long as half or more of the § 11 eligible
claimants make claims.  #5898, Ex. 2.  In other words, a single
pool of funds with use of differential multipliers eliminates the
possibility of windfall for some of the § 11 claims that would
arise if there were separate pools and a low claims rate for one
of the pools.  
Realizing that the single pool with use of multipliers
and separate pools are alternative methods to establish a Plan of
Allocation, neither perfect, each potentially favoring and/or
disfavoring some class members to some degree depending on the
circumstances, the Court finds the Lead Plaintiff has shown that


     21 Silvercreek Plaintiffs state that they excluded themselves
from the Citigroup, CIBC, JP Morgan Chase and Arthur Andersen
settlement classes.  They are members of the Bank of America,
Outside Directors, Lehman Brothers, Andersen Worldwide, and
Kirkland and Ellis classes.
- 27 -
the single-pool approach with the use of multipliers to put the
§ 11 Note purchasers in the same economic positions as if
segregation of the funds had occurred is a fair, reasonable, and
adequate means for distribution of the recovery funds in this
litigation.
The Silvercreek Plaintiffs further object to the failure
of Section C(1)(q) of the Plan of Allocation to properly address
the manner of distribution to class members who opted out of some
settlement classes while remaining in others.21
Lead Counsel responds that it has already explained to
the Silvercreek Plaintiffs by letter, “The Recognized Claims of
those who opted out of some, but not all, settlements will be
reduced by the amount of those settlements opted out of divided
by the total amount of all settlements.”  Letter from Helen J.
Hodges to Steven N. Williams, dated September 10, 2007
(Supplemental Compendium (#5910), Ex. 20).  The Silvercreek
Plaintiffs never responded to the letter nor objected again at the
preliminary approval stage last December.  Furthermore, argues
Lead Counsel, a pro rata adjustment is equitable and the
Silvercreek Plaintiffs fail to propose any alternative.  The Court


- 28 -
agrees with Lead Counsel that the letter’s response, which
Silvercreek 
Plaintiffs 
have 
not 
timely 
or 
substantively
challenged, is equitable and rational, and that it, too, is an
adequate, fair and reasonable solution.
e.  Wiley M. Cauthen (#5884) objects to exclusion of those who
acquired Enron securities before the Eligible Period and held them
during the Eligible Period.  Cauthen also objects to exclusion of
those who acquired Enron securities during or prior to the
Eligible Period by means of a gift, inheritance or operation of
law and held them during the Eligible Period.
Lead Counsel correctly cites the law often applied by
this Court in ruling on motions in this litigation:  “It is well
established that the mere retention of securities in reliance on
material misrepresentations or omissions does not form the basis
for § 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim.”  Krim v. BancTexas, Inc., 989
F.2d 1435, 1443 n.7 (5th Cir. 1993).  See also In re Enron Corp.
Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 284 F. Supp.2d 511, 635 (S.D.
Tex. 2003), citing Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S.
723 (1975), and Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.3d 461 (2d
Cir. 1952).  
Furthermore, a person who receives a security as a gift
or through inheritance, but who parts with no consideration and
incurs no liabilities in connection therewith, is not a purchaser


- 29 -
or seller of the security entitled to maintain a § 10(b) and Rule
10b-5 cause of action.  Rose v. Arkansas Valley Environmental &
Utility Authority, 462 F. Supp. 1180, 1188-89 (W.D. Mo.
1983)(donees and legatees lack standing to bring § 10(b) claims
because they are not purchasers or sellers), citing Blue Chip and
Birnbaum.  
Thus the Court overrules Mr. Cauthen’s objections.
f.  Fiduciary Counselors, as the independent fiduciary for the
Enron Corp. Savings Plan and the Enron Corp. Employee Stock
Ownership Plan, (#5869 at 18-22) focuses on § V.C.(j) of the
Notice:
An Authorized Claimant’s gains and losses on
a particular Eligible Security acquired in
the Eligible Period will be netted against
each other to determine the Authorized
Claimant’s net Recognized Claim on that
security.  In the case of Enron common stock
and options on that stock, gains and losses
on both the stock and options will be
combined and thereafter netted against each
other.  In all other cases, gains and losses
will not be netted or aggregated across
different Eligible Securities.  For example,
an Authorized Claimant’s Recognized Claim (as
calculated under this Plan) on Enron common
stock/options will not offset his/her/its
Recognized Claim (as calculated under this
Plan) on any issue of Enron Notes, nor will
any Authorized Claimant’s Recognized Claim on
one issue of Enron Note(s) offset any gains
on a different issue of Enron Note(s).
Id. (emphasis in original).


     22 Fiduciary Counselors notes the one exception for purchasers
of Enron stock and options on common stock, for which the Plan does
net (offset) gains and losses.
- 30 -
“A plan of allocation that reimburses class members on
the extent of their injuries is generally reasonable.”  Schwartz,
2005 WL 3148350, at *23, quoting In re Oracle Sec. Litig., [1994-
1995 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) 98,355, at 90,446
(N.D. Cal. 18, 1994).  Highlighting this statement, Fiduciary
Counselors objects that Notice § V.C.(j) is “fundamentally unfair”
because “those who traded multiple Eligible Securities and did not
suffer an overall loss on their Enron securities (or whose out of
pocket loss was offset in part by gains) may nevertheless claim
their full losses from that portion of their investments which
were unsuccessful.”22  #5969 at 18.  Since Eligible Claimants’
“gains and losses will not be netted or aggregated across
different Eligible Securities,” the proposed Plan also “would
provide a windfall for sophisticated investors, such as hedge
funds or arbitrageurs who engaged in hedging Enron stock against
Enron debt securities, as well as other investors who were simply
lucky enough to make money on one Enron security while also
suffering a loss in another.”  #5869 at 18.  Their actual injuries
from investing in Enron could be far less than their Recognized
Claim, or they might actually have no injuries at all (if their
gains offset their losses).  An investor who bought Enron bonds


- 31 -
and sold its Enron stock short might profit or break even when
Enron collapsed, but would still be allocated a portion of the
settlement fund for the bond loss.  Fiduciary Counselors argues
that the Plan compensates sophisticated investors to the detriment
of ordinary investors, including participants of the Enron Plans.
#5869 at 18-20,. Fiduciary Counselors disagrees with Lead
Counsel’s decision that “the balance of fairness weighs in favor
of allowing investors who invested in different types of
securities for different purposes to keep the profits from their
successful investments, while still compensating those investors
for their losses” because it fails “this Circuit’s fairness
analysis.”  #5869 at 21, citing In re Chicken Antitrust Litig.,
669 F.2d at 238.  Insisting its objection is not hypothetical,
Fiduciary Counselors points out that a fund of Wilbur L. Ross did
precisely that.  See WL Ross:  Hope Rising From the Ashes,
Euromoney, May 2002 at 80-81 (Ex. 8 to #5869)(“the fund went short
in Enron stock and simultaneously long in Enron bonds.  The profit
made from Enron’s precipitous decline from $30 to 30 cents-–the
level at which [the fund] sold out–-was given back when the bonds
also collapsed.  Ross [the chairman of the fund’s manager] says
the firm broke even on the Enron trade.”).
In response, Lead Counsel explains that the Plan
acknowledges the differing investment objectives of those who


- 32 -
purchased different kinds of Enron securities; it takes into
account the fact that purchasers of fixed income securities were
seeking regular interest payments under the notes, and that
purchasers of common stock looked to capital appreciation as their
major source of return and that during the class period they
commonly hedged their purchase of Enron common stocks with options
on Enron equities.  Because hedging of equity securities was so
common at the time, the Plan provides that “in the case of Enron
common stock and options on that stock, gains and losses on both
stock and options will be combined and thereafter netted against
each other.”  Notice, § V.C.1.(j).    
Lead Counsel further asserts that capital-structured
arbitrage only became an accepted investment technique in late
2001, i.e., at the end of the Enron debacle.  #5892 at 21-22,
citing Adam Bradbery, Hedge Funds Take a Capital-Structure
Arbitrage, Wall St. J., Aug. 19, 2003, found in Supplemental
Compendium 
(#5910), 
Ex. 
25; 
and 
Robert 
Clow, 
Global
Investing–Vultures Scour the Horizon for New Prey, Fin. Times,
Oct. 22, 2001 at 25, found in Supplemental Compendium (#5910) at
Ex. 26 at 25 (“The hedge fund managed by his W.L. Ross normally
engages in capital structure arbitrage, shorting the equities of
distressed companies, which could easily prove worthless, and
buying their bonds.”)  Because capital structure arbitrage was not


- 33 -
an established investment technique during the Eligible Period,
the identification of a single investor by Fiduciary Counselors
does not make the Plan unfair.
To Fiduciary Counselors’ contention that even ordinary
investors who traded in different bond classes could “reap
windfalls from the Plan of Allocation at the expense of Plan
Participants and other ordinary investors, Lead Counsel counters
that profits from these various bond transactions could have come
about from changes in interest rates or other factors not related
to fraud.  Furthermore, the Plan takes into account the different
motivations of investors in choosing different types of
securities.  Lead Plaintiff believes the Plan’s allocation is a
fair method to distribute the settlement proceeds.
Finally, Lead Plaintiff believes that “the balance of
fairness militates against offsetting gains and losses across all
classes of Eligible Securities.”  #5892 at 22.  Lead Plaintiff
similarly decided it was not fair to offset recoveries that
Eligible Claimants received from other legal proceedings against
distributions 
here; 
therefore 
the 
Plan 
does 
not 
offset
distributions that Eligible Claimants received in the Bankruptcy
proceedings nor recoveries they received in the Tittle action.
If the Plan were to net gains and losses of a Claimant across all
classes of Enron securities, in fairness it should also consider


- 34 -
offsetting 
gains 
from 
recoveries 
in 
these 
Enron-related
litigations.
This Court reiterates that there is no way to allocate
these proceeds that would not in some way favor or disfavor to
some degree some of the class members.  On the whole, the Court
finds that the considerations behind the Plan’s design to not
offset gains and losses across all classes of Eligible Securities
are very reasonable, and given the difficult balance of so many
factors, the chosen method is fair, adequate and reasonable.
g.  P.E. Ilavia (#5948) wrote a letter to the Court requesting
that it include the common stock he acquired through the stock
split that occurred on August 13, 1999 in what the Plan refers to
as “Enron Securities you purchased or otherwise acquired during
the period September 9, 1997 to December 2, 2001.”  The letter
states that Mr. Ilavia attended both the sessions held in Houston
by Gilardi & Co. for investors on March 27 and 29, 2008, where he
was told the split would not count as an eligible acquisition.
He argues, “A split is an acquisition of a corporation’s security,
as per SEC, and as such should be counted as an acquisition.”
 
Lead Plaintiff responds that the stock acquired in a 2-
for-one stock split on August 13, 1999 is not and should not be
included for distribution under the Plan of Allocation.  #5951 at
1-2.  If a person held ten shares on that date, he had twenty


- 35 -
shares after the split, and each share traded at half the price
on the day after the split (on August 13, 1999, the pre-split
price of an Enron share was $87.6888, and the next day, $43.875);
moreover, there was no payment made nor consideration given for
the additional shares.  See Richard A. Brealey and Stewart C.
Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance, at 291 (McGraw Hill, 3d
ed. 1988)(referring to split transactions as a “free gift” of
shares).  The Plan states, “For each unit of . . . Enron common
stock, . . . purchased in the Eligible Period, the Recognized Loss
. . . is the dollar amount of the inflation in the Purchase Price
Paid at date of acquisition times the number of units acquired,
minus the dollar amount of inflation in the Sale Price Received
at date of sale if sold prior to December 3, 2001, times the
number of units sold.”  #5789 or 5900, Notice at V.D.1.(a).
“Purchase Price Paid” is defined as “the amount paid or value of
the consideration given for each unit of the security.”  Id. at
V.D.  Since the amount paid or consideration given for the stock
received through the 2-for-1 stock split was zero at the time of
the split, the “Purchase Price Paid” for the stock acquired is
zero.  Because the investor paid nothing to “acquire” the stock
through the split, he has no Recognized Loss under the Plan for
the acquisition of those additional shares.  Lead Counsel
summarizes, “[R]eal economic losses are determined based on the


- 36 -
amount paid or consideration given at the time of the stock
acquisition.  When nothing was paid and no consideration was given
to acquire the stock, as in the stock split, there is no
compensable economic loss for additional shares received.”  #5951
at 2-3.
Although Mr. Ilavia reiterated his objection and other
complaints in another letter, #5957, the Court finds Lead
Counsel’s explanation clear, rational, and supported by the
language of the Plan.  It is also in accord with the law.  Rose
v. Arkansas Valley Environmental & Utility Authority, 462 F. Supp.
at 1188-89 (a person who receives a security as a gift or through
inheritance, but who parts with no consideration and incurs no
liabilities in connection therewith, is not a purchaser or seller
of the security entitled to maintain a § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
cause of action).  Accordingly the Court overrules Mr. Ilavia’s
objections. 
III.  Ruling
Having reviewed all submissions and heard oral arguments
at the Fairness Hearing, made findings of fact, and addressed all
pending objections, this Court finds that the proposed Plan of
Allocation is fair, adequate and reasonable.  Accordingly, the
Court


- 37 -
ORDERS that Lead Plaintiff’s motion for final approval
of the proposed Plan of allocation of the settlement proceeds
(instrument #5793) is GRANTED.
  
SIGNED at Houston, Texas, this 8th day of September,
2008.
