Conclusions of Law\nA.  Jurisdiction\nThe \nCourt \nhas \nfederal \nquestion \nsubject \nmatter\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 over this dispute arising out\nof violations of the federal securities laws, in particular \u00a7\u00a7\n10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n78j(b), 78t(a), and 78t-1, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the\n\n\n- 3 -\nSecurities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 77l(a)(2), and 77o.\nThis Court also has jurisdiction under the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) pursuant to \u00a7 22 of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77v, and \u00a7 27 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa.\nAs for personal jurisdiction over the absent plaintiff\nclass members, in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797\n(1985), the Supreme Court noted the distinction between an out-of-\nstate defendant haled into a foreign court to defend or suffer a\ndefault judgment and an absent class-action plaintiff who may lack\nall minimum contacts with the forum state and cited its earlier\nopinion in Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40-41 (1940):\n[A] \u201cclass\u201d or \u201crepresentative\u201d suit was an\nexception to the rule that one could not be\nbound by a judgment in personam unless one\nwas made fully a party in the traditional\nsense. . . . As the Court pointed out in\nHansberry, the class action was an invention\nof equity to enable it to proceed to a decree\nin suits where the number of those interested\nin the litigation was too great to permit\njoinder.  The absent parties would be bound\nby the decree so long as the named parties\nadequately represented the absent class and\nthe prosecution of the litigation was within\nthe common interest.\nShutts, 472 U.S. at 808.  Thus \u201ca forum State may exercise\njurisdiction over the claim of an absent class-action plaintiff,\neven though the plaintiff may not possess the minimum contacts\n\n\n- 4 -\nwith the forum which would support personal jurisdiction over a\ndefendant.\u201d  Id. at 811.  Nevertheless, \n[i]f the forum State wishes to bind an absent\nplaintiff concerning a claim for money\ndamages or similar relief at law, it must\nprovide \nminimal \nprocedural \ndue \nprocess\nprotection.  The plaintiff must receive\nnotice plus an opportunity to be heard and\nparticipate in the litigation, whether in\nperson or through counsel.  The notice must\nbe \nthe \nbest \npracticable, \n\u201creasonably\ncalculated \nunder \nall \ncircumstances, \nto\napprise interested parties of the pendency of\nth action and afford them an opportunity to\npresent their objections. . . . The notice\nshould \ndescribe \nthe \naction \nand \nthe\nplaintiffs\u2019 rights in it.  Additionally, we\nhold that due process requires at a minimum\nthat an absent plaintiff be provided with an\nopportunity to remove himself from the class\nby executing and returning an \u201copt out\u201d or\n\u201crequest for exclusion\u201d form to the court.\nFinally, the Due Process Clause of course\nrequires that the named plaintiff at all\ntimes adequately represent the interests of\nthe absent class members.\nId. at 811-12 [citations omitted]; see also Silber V. Mabon, 18\nF.3d 1449, 1453-54 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1994)(applying Shutts in\nsecurities class action).  \nB. Standard of Review\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) and\n(2), regarding a proposed settlement, \u201cThe court must direct\nnotice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be\nbound by the proposal. . . . If the proposal would bind class\nmembers, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on\n\n\n     3 Quoting Cohen v.

The same standard of review \u201capplies with\nas much force to the review of the allocation agreement as it does\nto the review of the overall settlement between plaintiffs and\ndefendants.\u201d  In re Chicken Antitrust Litig., 669 F.2d 228, 238\n(5th Cir. 1982), quoted for the same proposition, Schwartz v.

Generally courts will find\n\u201creasonable\u201d a plan of distribution that reimburses class members\nbased on the type and extent of their damages.  In re Ikon, 194\nF.R.D. at 184.  Nevertheless, \u201c\u2018a class action settlement need not\nnecessarily treat all class members equally.\u2019\u201d  Schwartz v. TSU\nCorp., No. 3:02-CV-2243-K, et al., 2005 WL 3148350, *23 (N.D.

As we have said elsewhere, a \u2018just result\nis often no more than an arbitrary point between competing notions\nof reasonableness.\u2019\u201d  Id., citing In re Corrugated Container\nAntitrust Litigation, 659 F.2d 1332, 1325 (5th Cir. 1981).  Lead\nPlaintiff emphasizes, through its expert Professor Roman Weil,\nthere is no single, unique, fair, reasonable and adequate Plan of\nAllocation. \nC.  Notice to Class Members\n\n\n- 7 -\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) requires for\nclasses certified under Rule 23(b)(3) \u201cthe best notice practicable\nunder the circumstances, including individual notice to all\nmembers who can be identified through reasonable effort.\u201d  Rule\n23(e)(1) mandates, \u201cThe court must direct notice in a reasonable\nmanner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.\u201d\nThe Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution also\nimposes minimum notice requirements, which are met if the notice\nsatisfies Rule 23(c)(2).  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S.\n156, 173-74 (1974)(for due process, notice in a class action must\nprovide a fair recital of the subject matter and of the proposed\nterms and must give the class an opportunity to be heard); In re\nNissan Motor Corp. Antitrust Litig., 552 F.2d 1088, 1097 (5th Cir.\n1977); Miller v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., 559 F.2d 426, 429-\n30 (5th Cir. 1977).  Generally the notice requirements of Federal\nR. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) may be met by a combination of individual\nnotice to identifiable class members and notice by publication.\n6A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. \u00a7 12:312 (and cases cited therein).  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the notice\nin a class action settlement must inform class members of \u201c(i) the\nnature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified;\n(iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class\nmember may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member\n\n\n     5 Under Article 581-33(a)(1) of the Texas Securities Act,\nrescission is the remedy if the purchaser still owns the securities\nor damages if he no longer does.

See,\ne.g., Miller, 559 F.2d at 429 (finding a period of four weeks\nbetween the mailing of the notice and the hearing to be\nsufficient).  Notice is \u201cadequate if it may be understood by the\naverage class member.  4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg\non Class Actions \u00a7 11:53 at 167 (4th ed. 2002).\nII.  Findings of Fact\nA.  Plan of Allocation\nA substantial difficulty, unusual if not unique, in\ndrafting a plan of allocation that was fair, reasonable, and\nadequate to all class members in the Newby litigation was the wide\nvariety \nof \nsecurities \ninvolved; \nthe \nsettlements \ncovered\napproximately 195 different Enron or Enron-related securities.\nFurthermore, there were claims under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b), 11 and the Texas\nSecurities Act, each with a different measure of damages.5\n\n\nHakim Deccach, 217 S.W.3d 430, 436 n.1 (Tex. 2007).  Section 11\ndamages are limited by statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k (plaintiff may\nrecover \u201cthe difference between the amount paid for the security)\nnot exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the\npublic)\u201d and (i) the value at the time the case was brought, or\n(ii) the price at which the security was sold before the case was\nbrought, or (iii) the price at which the security was sold after\nthe case was brought if that generates damages of less than the\ndifference between the price paid (limited to the offering price)\nand the value on the date the case was brought.  Section 10(b)\nprevailing securities investors recover inflation-adjusted losses.\nPursuant to case law, since the statute does not establish a\nmeans of measuring damages, Professor Weil explains that the Plan\nmeasures \u00a7 10(b) losses based on inflation, by using a value line,\na standard method of measuring class damages, and the Court refers\nthe parties to that discussion rather than repeating it here.  See\n#5794 at 8-10.  After reviewing the whole Plan of Allocation,\nProfessor Weil concluded that the Plan is fair, reasonable and\nadequate.  Id. at 10.\n- 9 -\nThe Court finds that the settlement Notice, in clear\nlanguage easily understandable by a layman, defined the class,\napprised the potential class members of the terms of the\nsettlement, the proposed plan of allocation and their options,\ntheir right to participate in the cash distribution by filing a\ntimely and valid Proof of Claim form, and their right to object\nand to be heard at the Fairness Hearing on February 29, 2008.\nNotice was timely given, approximately two months prior to the\nFairness Hearing.\nPursuant to Stipulations of Settlement, the settlement\nfund recovered from nine partial settlements and resolution of the\nLJM2 bankruptcy claim amounts to $7,227,390,000, plus interest,\n\n\n     6 The Notice at VII informs class members of the amounts of\nmoney and percentages Lead Counsel and class representatives are\nseeking as fees and expenses. The Court addresses the issues of\nLead Counsel\u2019s fee award and of class representatives\u2019 expenses in\nseparate orders.\n     7 All the definitions of terms used in the Plan are found at\n#5900, Ex. A, Notice at \u00a7 III.\n     8 Lead Counsel states it received assistance from Stanford\nConsulting (a damages consultant), Chris Patti (University Counsel\nfor the Regents), consultants Robert Fairbank and Rock Hanken,\nhired by the Regents, and Professor Roman Weil, in preparing the\nPlan of Allocation.  #5897 at 10-11, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40, 42.\n- 10 -\nand minus notice and administration  expenses, Lead Counsel\u2019s fees\nand expenses, and various plaintiffs\u2019 costs and expenses.  \nUnder the proposed Plan of Allocation, the settlement\nfund, net of expenses and the fee award,6 would be distributed to\n\u201cEligible Claimants,\u201d as defined in the Plan,7 on the basis of\ntheir individual claims.  See Corrected Order Approving Form and\nManner of Notice, #5789, Ex. A, \u00a7 V.A.; also found at Declaration\nof Carole K. Sylvester, #5900, Ex. A, \u201cNotice,\u201d \u00a7 V. A.  The\nproposed Plan of Allocation is described in the Notice mailed on\nDecember 21, 2007 to all persons and their beneficiaries who\npurchased or acquired any Enron securities or Enron-related\nsecurities by any method from September 9, 1997 to December 2,\n2001.  Id. at \u00a7 V and Declaration of Carole K. Sylvester, #5900\nat 2.  The proposed Plan was drafted by Lead Counsel and Lead\nPlaintiff, aided by their damage consultants and others,8 and with\nconsultation with other attorneys in this litigation, for\n\n\n     9 Category 1 securities include Enron common stock, Enron debt\n(Notes), Enron preferred securities, put and call options on Enron\ncommon stock, and derivatives known as the \u201cForeign Debt\nSecurities.\u201d\n- 11 -\ndistribution of the settlement fund to investors who suffered\nlosses resulting from the alleged Enron fraud and to pay for the\nexpense of the litigation.  The proposed Plan was first published\nin July 2007 for public comment, available on the web site\nwww.enronfraud.com.  After receiving and reviewing public comments\nand further discussions with its consultants, Lead Plaintiff made\nadjustments to the Plan.  Subsequently in negotiating with\nobjectors, other changes were made.\nLead Counsel divided the eligible securities, listed in\nexhibits 1 and 3 to the Notice, into two groups.  #5756 at 3-4;\nNotice at V.B. (#5900 Ex. A).  \nThe first group (\u201cCategory 1\") were securities issued\nby Enron, some of its predecessor firms (Internorth or Houston\nNatural Gas) or trusts, or other entities created by Enron for the\npurpose of issuing a particular security, or were derivatives of\nthose securities.9  Id.  Their price or value during the Eligible\nPeriod (September 9, 1997 through December 2, 2001, inclusive) was\nmainly dependent on Enron\u2019s credit, financial condition or ability\nto pay, and disclosure of alleged fraud at Enron had to cause\nmovement in the price of these securities.  Id. at 4.  This group\nwere the main focus of the Newby litigation and therefore the Plan\n\n\n     10 Lead Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Professor Ramon Weill, explains\nthat Category 1 is composed of securities which the Newby complaint\nasserted, while Category 2 is composed of \u201csecurities that the\nsettling defendants added to the set of securities subject to the\nsettlements.\u201d  #5794 at 6.\n     11 The Plan makes clear that in accordance with federal\nsecurities law, \u201cThe market price (or value, if market prices are\n- 12 -\nof Allocation is structured to distribute about 95% of the\nproceeds to them.  Id.  \nThe second group, \u201cCategory 2,\u201d10 were composed of\nsecurities issued by Enron-related entities, including equity,\ndebt, preferred securities and derivatives of those securities.\nDisclosure of the alleged fraud at Enron did not affect the prices\nof some of them (listed in Exhibit 2), and the plan of allocation\ntherefore excludes those from participation in the settlement\nfunds.  Other Category 2 securities\u2019 prices were affected by the\ndisclosures; thus purchasers and acquirers of those securities,\nlisted in exhibit 1, which is not necessarily exhaustive, do share\nin the distribution.  Still other Category 2 securities, listed\nin exhibit 3, are classified in an \u201cunknown\u201d category because\npricing data for them was not available despite great efforts by\nLead Counsel and its damages expert to obtain them.  Thus these\nmay share in the distribution, but only if the claimant presents\nadequate evidence of both the price or value of the security and\nof a decline in that the price or value caused by disclosure of\nalleged fraud at Enron.11  Furthermore, because the claims for\n\n\nnot available) of the Enron or Enron-Related Security, must have\ndeclined due to disclosure of the alleged Enron fraud.\u201d  #5900,\nNotice, \u00a7 V.C.(g).\n- 13 -\neligible Category 2 securities were determined by Lead Counsel to\nbe \u201cweaker\u201d than the Category 1 claims, the plan of allocation\nlimits distribution to them to 5% of the settlement proceeds.  Id.\nLead Plaintiff adequately explains that in an effort to\nbe fair to all eligible claimants, for at least two reasons it\ncommingled the settlement funds into a single pool, rather than\nallocating them into different pools with distribution dependent\non the particular claims (\u00a7 10(b) or \u00a7 11) asserted against a\nparticular defendant.  First, even when a settlement was achieved\nagainst a particular defendant at a time when only one type of\nclaim was pending against it, e.g., a \u00a7 11 claim, having different\npools would not have recognized that in certain circumstances,\nother claims, e.g., \u00a7 10(b) claims, had been asserted against that\nsame defendant but had been dismissed, leaving appellate exposure\nagainst that defendant.  Second, if a specific amount was\nallocated to cover only a particular security and the number of\nclaims made based on that security was significantly lower than\nthat for other eligible securities, a windfall would result for\nthose claimants.  Because the Regents observed that certain \u00a7 11\nclaims drove certain settlements with certain defendants, the\nRegents, with the aid of its economic/damage expert, created\n\n\n     12 For example, purchasers of Enron\u2019s 7% Notes, which had both\n\u00a7 10(b) and \u00a7 11 claims, that have a \u201cRecognized Claim\u201d are\nentitled to the greater of the \u00a7 10(b) measure of loss or three\ntimes the \u00a7 11 measure of loss and they share in total settlements,\nincluding the $6.5 billion generated through the settlements of \u00a7\n10(b) claims.  See #5764.

The Plan treats all Eligible Claimants\nsimilarly, so everyone entitled to a distribution who submits a\nvalid and timely claim will receive a pro rata share of the Net\nSettlement Fund in the proportion that his \u201cRecognized Claim\u201d13\n\n\nmultiplier.\u201d  Under V.C.1.(b), a \u201c\u2018Recognized Claim\u2019 is the amount\nof a claim under this Plan after the application of a multiplier,\nor, if no multiplier is applied, remains equal to the Recognized\nLoss.\u201d\n- 15 -\nbears to the total of all Recognized Claims.  As Professor Weil\ndeclares, \u201cIn general each Authorized Claimant will receive an\namount determined by multiplying the net settlement fund by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the authorized claimant\u2019s\nRecognized Claim and the denominator of which is the total\nRecognized Claims of all Authorized Claimants.\u201d  #5794 at 7-8.\nLead Counsel estimates that there are more than a million class\nmembers \nwho \nmay \nsubmit \nclaims \nand \nsubsequently \nreceive\ndistributions of the settlement funds.  #5794 at 5, \u00b6 20.\nThe Court finds that the Plan of Allocation was\nnegotiated at arm\u2019s length, with no evidence, nor allegations, of\ncollusion, and that the allocation is fair, reasonable and\nadequate as to Class Members.  The Court further finds that\nmethodology used by Lead Counsel took into consideration the\nunique facts and circumstances of this litigation, interclass\ndistinctions based on the relative strength and weaknesses of the\ndifferent claims, the timing of purchases and sales, the magnitude\nof the loss, and the different kinds of recovery available under\nthe different statutes, in producing a fair, adequate and\nreasonable plan for distribution of the funds.  The Court notes\nthat the Plan Allocation has also been found to be fair, adequate,\n\n\n- 16 -\nand reasonable by expert Professor Ramon Weil, after careful\nexamination of its underlying facts and principles.  #5795 at 6-10\nThe Court finds that Lead Plaintiff has given the best\nnotice practicable under the circumstances and has fully satisfied\nall applicable notice requirements, including the United States\nConstitution, Rule 23(e) and Rule 23(c)(2)\u2019s requirement of\nindividual notice \u201cto all members who can be identified through\nreasonable effort.\u201d  Reasonable Notice of the Plan of Allocation\nand opportunity to opt out were provided to in-state and out-of-\nstate Class Members in this action, pursuant to this Court\u2019s\norder.

Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir.\n1977)(\u201cParticularly in class action suits, there is an overriding\npublic interest in favor of settlement.\u201d).\n- 18 -\nLead Plaintiff observes that although the class members\u2019\nlosses are approximately $44 billion, the settlement fund is\ncomposed of limited dollars (approximately $7.2 billion) for which\nthere are competing claimants; there are more than one million\nclass members who may make claims and receive distributions.\nInevitably some will complain that the Plan of Allocation is\nunfair to them.  If changes are made to the current Plan in\nresponse to objections, some claimants will receive more and\nothers less.  Lead Plaintiff urges, \u201cWhile the Plan may not\nsatisfy every potential claimant, that does not mean that it is\nunfair.  To the contrary, the Plan is the product of serious\ninformed choices, is fair, reasonable and adequate and should be\nfinally approved.\u201d  #5892 at 3.  This Court agrees.  Moreover, in\naddition to the strong policy favoring settlement in class action\nsuits,14 the Court notes that had the partial settlements in this\nlitigation not been achieved when they were, under the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s recent ruling in Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 761 (2008), most of the\nrecovery fund based on \u00a7 10(b) claims would likely not have been\nobtained by Newby plaintiffs.\n1.  Resolved Objections\n\n\n- 19 -\nObjections filed by several class members have been\nresolved:  (1) the J. Corman Family Limited Partnership # 3, which\nobjected (#5859)to the inflation percentage (76%) attributed to\nEnron \u201cbond-like\u201d preferred stock, compared with that (94%) for\ncommon stock and \u201cstock-like\u201d preferred, was resolved when Lead\nCounsel agreed to modify the plan of allocation (#5936 at 1); (2)\nthe Ruben Parties, who complained that the Plan discriminates\nagainst Eligible Claimants who \u201cacquired\u201d rather than purchased\nEligible Securities (#5861, 5860, 5919) was resolved and withdrawn\n(#5934, 5936 at 1); (3) Nathaniel Pulsifer as Trustee of the\nShooter\u2019s Hill Revocable Trust (#5764, 5783); and (4) Brian\nDabrowski (#5759, 5783).\n2.  Pending Objections\na.  Stanley Majors (#5840) complains that the cut-off date of the\nEligible Period for reimbursement, December 2, 2001 is too early\nbecause he purchased his Enron stock after Enron was in\nbankruptcy, beginning in January, 2003, at less that eight cents\nper share.\nAs Lead Plaintiff responds, the Regents never included\n2002 and 2003 in their complaint nor asserted any basis to do so.\nMoreover, Mr. Majors concedes that he purchased the stock in 2003\n\u201cwhen ENRON was in bankruptcy and \u2018fraud\u2019 was not told to me when\nI purchased my stocks,\u201d but that he did so because \u201c[i]t still\n\n\n     15 Joined by Nasser Pebdani (#5877).\n- 20 -\nlooked to me Enron would come out of bankruptcy and be a viable\ncompany once again.\u201d  His investment decision was not based on the\nsame facts and circumstances as those asserted on behalf of the\nclass in the Newby complaint.  \nThe Court agrees with Lead Plaintiff and overrules Mr.\nMajors\u2019 objection.  \nb.  Larry Fenstad and Dorothy Lancaster McCoppin15 (#5868) complain\nthat (1) the Notice and Proof of Claim form are confusing; (2)\nthere is no timetable for the Claims Administrator (Gilardi & Co.)\nto resolve claims; (3) the Court should require reports about the\nstatus of distribution from Claims Administrator every 90 days;\n(4) should have an appeals process; (5) the deadline for filing\nclaims should be extended; (6) additional instructions from\nAdministrator should be given to all class members; and (7) the\nclaims deadline should be extended.\n The Court finds these objections should be overruled.\nWhen this Court approved the form and matter of the Notice and\nProof of Claim Form (#5789) prior to its being mailed to potential\nclass members, the Court had already found that the Notice, along\nwith the Proof of Claim form, while addressing a complex matter,\nis clear, understandable by laymen, and adequately informative.\nIf they were confused, the Plan referred then to two web sites,\n\n\n- 21 -\nwww.gilardi.com or www.enronfraud.com and stated they could write\nto Lead Counsel about any questions regarding the Plan of\nAllocation.  Notice at \u00a7 X.  In addition, two open meetings were\nheld on March 27 and 29, 2008 in Houston, Texas for Enron class\nmembers, and representatives of Lead Counsel and of the Claims\nAdministrator were present to answer individual questions\nregarding the Plan of Allocation and the Proof of Claim Form.\nThese objectors have not indicated if they utilized any of these\nopportunities to express their questions.  Lead Counsel has shown\nthat Gilardi & Co. is an experienced and reliable claims\nadministrator that has administered claims in hundreds of other\nsecurities class actions.  See www.gilardi.com.  See also #5892\nat 5; Declaration of Dennis A. Gilardi (# 5899)(\u201cDuring the past\n25 years, Gilardi has provided notice and administration services\nin more than 2,500 class actions.\u201d).  Its personnel answer\ntelephone calls, email, and regular mail inquiries from claimants.\n#5899 at 3.  They provide individual review of claims, provide\ninformation about any deficiencies in the claims or documentation\nnecessary to support them, and help each claimant throughout the\nprocess to cure any deficiency where possible.  Id. at 4-5\n(\u201cGilardi views its role in the deficiency and cure process as\nthat of a facilitator, and never as an adversary.\u201d).  Furthermore\nthere is an appeals process in the Plan:  if the Claims\n\n\n- 22 -\nAdministrator \nrejects \nthe \nclaimant\u2019s \nclaim, \nthe \nClaims\nAdministrator will send a rejection letter advising the claimant\nof his rights and the reasons for the rejection, and the claimant\nmay request an administrative review and/or has recourse to turn\nto the Court and ask it to review his claim.  Id. at 4-6; #5900,\nNotice, Ex. A, \u00a7 V.E.(5)(\u201cThe Court reserves jurisdiction to\nmodify, amend, or alter the Plan of Allocation without further\nnotice or to allow or disallow or adjust any Authorized Claimant\u2019s\nclaim, to ensure fair and equitable distribution of funds.\u201d).  As\nfor any time limits, Gilardi is \u201ccommitted to an efficient and\ntimely distribution of the Fund\u201d.  #5899 at 6.  As noted by Lead\nCounsel, there are a number of factors beyond Gilardi\u2019s control:\nwhether the Plan of Allocation approved by the Court is appealed;\nhow complete, accurate and properly supported by documentation the\nsubmitted claims are; how many Eligible Claimants will require\nassistance from Gilardi and Lead Counsel; and how many will\nrequest a Court review of Gilardi\u2019s determination.  As for any\ndelays in claimants\u2019 obtaining the necessary documentation to\nsupport their claims, the Court has authorized Lead Counsel, \u201cin\ntheir discretion, [to] accept for processing late claims so long\nas the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund to Authorized\nClaimants is not materially delayed thereby.  The Court finds\n\n\n- 23 -\nunnecessary periodic reports from the Claims Administrator and\nperiodic or delayed payments for its services.\nMr. Fenstad and Ms. McCoppin also request the Court to\nprovide them with \u201ca reasonable incentive award\u201d for their\nservices as class representatives and objectors.  As this Court\nhas indicated in #5996, such incentive awards are contrary to the\npolicy behind the PSLRA.  Thus the Court denies the request.\nc.  Jeanette Dreisbach (#5873) complains that shareholders will\nonly receive a distribution of $6.79 per share of common stock,\nespecially in view of the settlement recovery of $7.227 billion.\nShe asks the Court to \u201c[a]llow individual investors/shareholders\nto recover full amount of loss then whatever amount remains in the\nAllocation Fund be split fairly among the other plaintiffs who\nwere acting as money managers for other people\u2019s money and did not\nsuffer personal loss.\u201d  \nWhile the \u201cmoney managers\u201d may not personally have lost\nmoney, their clients or plan participants surely did.  The\ninstitutional investors deserve a fair allocation of the\nsettlement funds as much as the individual investors do.  Ms.\nDreisbach\u2019s objection is overruled.  \n\n\n     \n16 Silvercreek Management, Inc., Silvercreek Limited\nPartnership, Silvercreek II Limited, OIP Limited and Pebble Limited\nPartnership.\n     17 Originally the Silvercreek Plaintiffs joined in the\nOpposition of Nathaniel Pulsifer as Trustee of Shooter\u2019s Hill\nRevocable Trust (#5764), investors in Enron 7% Exchangeable Notes,\narguing that the Plan failed to segregate the funds from the\nsection 11 claims from the funds from the section 10(b) claims.\nAfter Pulsifer and Lead Plaintiff resolved Pulsifer\u2019s objection by\nadjusting the Plan by increasing the size of the multiplier for the\n7% Exchangeable Notes, Silvercreek filed its own objection.  \n     18 Specifically they contend that the funds from the \u201cpure \u00a7\n11 settlements\u201d (with Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, and the\nOutside Directors) are improperly commingled with the remaining\nEnron settlements, which included settlement by parties who were\nliable to all Enron stakeholders, and not just to investors in\ncertain specific Enron Securities.\n     19 Bank of America, Outside Directors, and Lehman Brothers.\n- 24 -\nd.  Silvercreek Plaintiffs16 (#5874)17 object that the plan, with\nits single pool, improperly intermingles funds from different\nsettlements18 and thereby unfairly dilutes the recovery of class\nmember owners of the  7%, 7.375%, 7.875%, and Zero Coupon Notes,\nwhose claims arise exclusively or predominately under Section 11,\nin favor of open market securities, whose claims are predicated\nsolely or predominately on Section 10(b).  Because the section 11\ndefendants19 settled claims arising under only that statute,\nSilvercreek Plaintiffs contend that there is no basis to require\nthe settlement consideration paid by them to be distributed to\nother class members who have no claim against these defendants.\nRather than using multipliers and a single pool, the Silvercreek\n\n\n     20 The Silvercreek Plaintiffs\u2019 objections (that access to the\nsettlement funds from section 11 claims should be limited to\nsection 11 claimants) were previously raised by Nathaniel Pulsifer,\nas Trustee of the Shooter\u2019s Hill Revocable Trust, with regard to\nthe preliminary approval of the Plan of Allocation.\n- 25 -\nPlaintiffs want separate pools of funds established for the\nsection 11 claimants and a single pool for all the rest.\nLead Plaintiff urges the Court to overrule the\nSilvercreek Plaintiffs\u2019 objection that the claims of class members\nwith \u00a7 11 claims are being diminished in favor of class members\nwith \u00a7 10(b) claims.  It first insists that monies obtained in\nsettlement of the 7% Note claims were obtained in exchange for\nextinguishment of both \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 10(b) claims, and thus should\nnot be segregated from other \u00a7 10(b) claims.  See Lead Plaintiff\u2019s\nResponse to Nathaniel Pulsifer\u2019s Opposition,20 #5774 at 1.  For\nexample, even though the \u00a7 10(b) claims against it had been\ndismissed, the Bank of America demanded, and was accorded, as a\ncondition of the settlement a broad definition of the settlement\nclass and releases of \u00a7 10(b) claims relating to many Enron or\nEnron-related securities.\nSecond, \nLead \nCounsel \nargues \nagainst \nSilvercreek\nPlaintiffs, establishing separate pools of funds for \u00a7 11\npurchasers could result in disparate recoveries among claimants\nbecause of disparate claim rates.  Supplemental Declaration of its\nPlan expert, Professor Roman L. Weil (#5898).  Professor Ramon\n\n\n- 26 -\nWeil explains that such an allocation could result unfairly in\n\u201ceventual outcomes to participants that could be so disparate as\nto violate the principle underlying the Plan that all authorized\nclaimants be treated in a way so as to nullify the effect of\ndifferential claims rates.\u201d  See Weil Supplemental Declaration\n(#5898 at 1), citing Weil Declaration (#5794) at \u00b6 23(h).  Exhibit\n1 to #5898, asserts Professor Weil, shows how reasonably different\nclaims rates could lead to disparate recovery rates, exactly what\nLead Plaintiff has tried to avoid.  Instead, under the Plan, he\nmaintains, if the claims rates turn out to be the same across\nclasses of claims, with the use of multipliers the \u00a7 11 securities\nwill receive the amounts they would have gotten if there had been\nseparate pools, as long as half or more of the \u00a7 11 eligible\nclaimants make claims.  #5898, Ex. 2.  In other words, a single\npool of funds with use of differential multipliers eliminates the\npossibility of windfall for some of the \u00a7 11 claims that would\narise if there were separate pools and a low claims rate for one\nof the pools.  \nRealizing that the single pool with use of multipliers\nand separate pools are alternative methods to establish a Plan of\nAllocation, neither perfect, each potentially favoring and/or\ndisfavoring some class members to some degree depending on the\ncircumstances, the Court finds the Lead Plaintiff has shown that\n\n\n     21 Silvercreek Plaintiffs state that they excluded themselves\nfrom the Citigroup, CIBC, JP Morgan Chase and Arthur Andersen\nsettlement classes.  They are members of the Bank of America,\nOutside Directors, Lehman Brothers, Andersen Worldwide, and\nKirkland and Ellis classes.\n- 27 -\nthe single-pool approach with the use of multipliers to put the\n\u00a7 11 Note purchasers in the same economic positions as if\nsegregation of the funds had occurred is a fair, reasonable, and\nadequate means for distribution of the recovery funds in this\nlitigation.\nThe Silvercreek Plaintiffs further object to the failure\nof Section C(1)(q) of the Plan of Allocation to properly address\nthe manner of distribution to class members who opted out of some\nsettlement classes while remaining in others.21\nLead Counsel responds that it has already explained to\nthe Silvercreek Plaintiffs by letter, \u201cThe Recognized Claims of\nthose who opted out of some, but not all, settlements will be\nreduced by the amount of those settlements opted out of divided\nby the total amount of all settlements.\u201d  Letter from Helen J.\nHodges to Steven N. Williams, dated September 10, 2007\n(Supplemental Compendium (#5910), Ex. 20).  The Silvercreek\nPlaintiffs never responded to the letter nor objected again at the\npreliminary approval stage last December.  Furthermore, argues\nLead Counsel, a pro rata adjustment is equitable and the\nSilvercreek Plaintiffs fail to propose any alternative.  The Court\n\n\n- 28 -\nagrees with Lead Counsel that the letter\u2019s response, which\nSilvercreek \nPlaintiffs \nhave \nnot \ntimely \nor \nsubstantively\nchallenged, is equitable and rational, and that it, too, is an\nadequate, fair and reasonable solution.\ne.  Wiley M. Cauthen (#5884) objects to exclusion of those who\nacquired Enron securities before the Eligible Period and held them\nduring the Eligible Period.  Cauthen also objects to exclusion of\nthose who acquired Enron securities during or prior to the\nEligible Period by means of a gift, inheritance or operation of\nlaw and held them during the Eligible Period.\nLead Counsel correctly cites the law often applied by\nthis Court in ruling on motions in this litigation:  \u201cIt is well\nestablished that the mere retention of securities in reliance on\nmaterial misrepresentations or omissions does not form the basis\nfor \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim.\u201d  Krim v. BancTexas, Inc., 989\nF.2d 1435, 1443 n.7 (5th Cir. 1993).  See also In re Enron Corp.\nSec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 284 F. Supp.2d 511, 635 (S.D.\nTex. 2003), citing Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S.\n723 (1975), and Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.3d 461 (2d\nCir. 1952).  \nFurthermore, a person who receives a security as a gift\nor through inheritance, but who parts with no consideration and\nincurs no liabilities in connection therewith, is not a purchaser\n\n\n- 29 -\nor seller of the security entitled to maintain a \u00a7 10(b) and Rule\n10b-5 cause of action.  Rose v. Arkansas Valley Environmental &\nUtility Authority, 462 F. Supp. 1180, 1188-89 (W.D. Mo.\n1983)(donees and legatees lack standing to bring \u00a7 10(b) claims\nbecause they are not purchasers or sellers), citing Blue Chip and\nBirnbaum.  \nThus the Court overrules Mr. Cauthen\u2019s objections.\nf.  Fiduciary Counselors, as the independent fiduciary for the\nEnron Corp. Savings Plan and the Enron Corp. Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan, (#5869 at 18-22) focuses on \u00a7 V.C.(j) of the\nNotice:\nAn Authorized Claimant\u2019s gains and losses on\na particular Eligible Security acquired in\nthe Eligible Period will be netted against\neach other to determine the Authorized\nClaimant\u2019s net Recognized Claim on that\nsecurity.  In the case of Enron common stock\nand options on that stock, gains and losses\non both the stock and options will be\ncombined and thereafter netted against each\nother.  In all other cases, gains and losses\nwill not be netted or aggregated across\ndifferent Eligible Securities.  For example,\nan Authorized Claimant\u2019s Recognized Claim (as\ncalculated under this Plan) on Enron common\nstock/options will not offset his/her/its\nRecognized Claim (as calculated under this\nPlan) on any issue of Enron Notes, nor will\nany Authorized Claimant\u2019s Recognized Claim on\none issue of Enron Note(s) offset any gains\non a different issue of Enron Note(s).\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n     22 Fiduciary Counselors notes the one exception for purchasers\nof Enron stock and options on common stock, for which the Plan does\nnet (offset) gains and losses.\n- 30 -\n\u201cA plan of allocation that reimburses class members on\nthe extent of their injuries is generally reasonable.\u201d  Schwartz,\n2005 WL 3148350, at *23, quoting In re Oracle Sec. Litig., [1994-\n1995 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) 98,355, at 90,446\n(N.D. Cal. 18, 1994).  Highlighting this statement, Fiduciary\nCounselors objects that Notice \u00a7 V.C.(j) is \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d\nbecause \u201cthose who traded multiple Eligible Securities and did not\nsuffer an overall loss on their Enron securities (or whose out of\npocket loss was offset in part by gains) may nevertheless claim\ntheir full losses from that portion of their investments which\nwere unsuccessful.\u201d22  #5969 at 18.  Since Eligible Claimants\u2019\n\u201cgains and losses will not be netted or aggregated across\ndifferent Eligible Securities,\u201d the proposed Plan also \u201cwould\nprovide a windfall for sophisticated investors, such as hedge\nfunds or arbitrageurs who engaged in hedging Enron stock against\nEnron debt securities, as well as other investors who were simply\nlucky enough to make money on one Enron security while also\nsuffering a loss in another.\u201d  #5869 at 18.  Their actual injuries\nfrom investing in Enron could be far less than their Recognized\nClaim, or they might actually have no injuries at all (if their\ngains offset their losses).  An investor who bought Enron bonds\n\n\n- 31 -\nand sold its Enron stock short might profit or break even when\nEnron collapsed, but would still be allocated a portion of the\nsettlement fund for the bond loss.  Fiduciary Counselors argues\nthat the Plan compensates sophisticated investors to the detriment\nof ordinary investors, including participants of the Enron Plans.\n#5869 at 18-20,. Fiduciary Counselors disagrees with Lead\nCounsel\u2019s decision that \u201cthe balance of fairness weighs in favor\nof allowing investors who invested in different types of\nsecurities for different purposes to keep the profits from their\nsuccessful investments, while still compensating those investors\nfor their losses\u201d because it fails \u201cthis Circuit\u2019s fairness\nanalysis.\u201d  #5869 at 21, citing In re Chicken Antitrust Litig.,\n669 F.2d at 238.  Insisting its objection is not hypothetical,\nFiduciary Counselors points out that a fund of Wilbur L. Ross did\nprecisely that.  See WL Ross:  Hope Rising From the Ashes,\nEuromoney, May 2002 at 80-81 (Ex. 8 to #5869)(\u201cthe fund went short\nin Enron stock and simultaneously long in Enron bonds.  The profit\nmade from Enron\u2019s precipitous decline from $30 to 30 cents-\u2013the\nlevel at which [the fund] sold out\u2013-was given back when the bonds\nalso collapsed.  Ross [the chairman of the fund\u2019s manager] says\nthe firm broke even on the Enron trade.\u201d).\nIn response, Lead Counsel explains that the Plan\nacknowledges the differing investment objectives of those who\n\n\n- 32 -\npurchased different kinds of Enron securities; it takes into\naccount the fact that purchasers of fixed income securities were\nseeking regular interest payments under the notes, and that\npurchasers of common stock looked to capital appreciation as their\nmajor source of return and that during the class period they\ncommonly hedged their purchase of Enron common stocks with options\non Enron equities.  Because hedging of equity securities was so\ncommon at the time, the Plan provides that \u201cin the case of Enron\ncommon stock and options on that stock, gains and losses on both\nstock and options will be combined and thereafter netted against\neach other.\u201d  Notice, \u00a7 V.C.1.(j).    \nLead Counsel further asserts that capital-structured\narbitrage only became an accepted investment technique in late\n2001, i.e., at the end of the Enron debacle.  #5892 at 21-22,\nciting Adam Bradbery, Hedge Funds Take a Capital-Structure\nArbitrage, Wall St. J., Aug. 19, 2003, found in Supplemental\nCompendium \n(#5910), \nEx. \n25; \nand \nRobert \nClow, \nGlobal\nInvesting\u2013Vultures Scour the Horizon for New Prey, Fin. Times,\nOct. 22, 2001 at 25, found in Supplemental Compendium (#5910) at\nEx. 26 at 25 (\u201cThe hedge fund managed by his W.L. Ross normally\nengages in capital structure arbitrage, shorting the equities of\ndistressed companies, which could easily prove worthless, and\nbuying their bonds.\u201d)  Because capital structure arbitrage was not\n\n\n- 33 -\nan established investment technique during the Eligible Period,\nthe identification of a single investor by Fiduciary Counselors\ndoes not make the Plan unfair.\nTo Fiduciary Counselors\u2019 contention that even ordinary\ninvestors who traded in different bond classes could \u201creap\nwindfalls from the Plan of Allocation at the expense of Plan\nParticipants and other ordinary investors, Lead Counsel counters\nthat profits from these various bond transactions could have come\nabout from changes in interest rates or other factors not related\nto fraud.  Furthermore, the Plan takes into account the different\nmotivations of investors in choosing different types of\nsecurities.  Lead Plaintiff believes the Plan\u2019s allocation is a\nfair method to distribute the settlement proceeds.\nFinally, Lead Plaintiff believes that \u201cthe balance of\nfairness militates against offsetting gains and losses across all\nclasses of Eligible Securities.\u201d  #5892 at 22.  Lead Plaintiff\nsimilarly decided it was not fair to offset recoveries that\nEligible Claimants received from other legal proceedings against\ndistributions \nhere; \ntherefore \nthe \nPlan \ndoes \nnot \noffset\ndistributions that Eligible Claimants received in the Bankruptcy\nproceedings nor recoveries they received in the Tittle action.\nIf the Plan were to net gains and losses of a Claimant across all\nclasses of Enron securities, in fairness it should also consider\n\n\n- 34 -\noffsetting \ngains \nfrom \nrecoveries \nin \nthese \nEnron-related\nlitigations.\nThis Court reiterates that there is no way to allocate\nthese proceeds that would not in some way favor or disfavor to\nsome degree some of the class members.  On the whole, the Court\nfinds that the considerations behind the Plan\u2019s design to not\noffset gains and losses across all classes of Eligible Securities\nare very reasonable, and given the difficult balance of so many\nfactors, the chosen method is fair, adequate and reasonable.\ng.  P.E. Ilavia (#5948) wrote a letter to the Court requesting\nthat it include the common stock he acquired through the stock\nsplit that occurred on August 13, 1999 in what the Plan refers to\nas \u201cEnron Securities you purchased or otherwise acquired during\nthe period September 9, 1997 to December 2, 2001.\u201d  The letter\nstates that Mr. Ilavia attended both the sessions held in Houston\nby Gilardi & Co. for investors on March 27 and 29, 2008, where he\nwas told the split would not count as an eligible acquisition.\nHe argues, \u201cA split is an acquisition of a corporation\u2019s security,\nas per SEC, and as such should be counted as an acquisition.\u201d\n \nLead Plaintiff responds that the stock acquired in a 2-\nfor-one stock split on August 13, 1999 is not and should not be\nincluded for distribution under the Plan of Allocation.  #5951 at\n1-2.  If a person held ten shares on that date, he had twenty\n\n\n- 35 -\nshares after the split, and each share traded at half the price\non the day after the split (on August 13, 1999, the pre-split\nprice of an Enron share was $87.6888, and the next day, $43.875);\nmoreover, there was no payment made nor consideration given for\nthe additional shares.  See Richard A. Brealey and Stewart C.\nMyers, Principles of Corporate Finance, at 291 (McGraw Hill, 3d\ned. 1988)(referring to split transactions as a \u201cfree gift\u201d of\nshares).  The Plan states, \u201cFor each unit of . . . Enron common\nstock, . . . purchased in the Eligible Period, the Recognized Loss\n. . . is the dollar amount of the inflation in the Purchase Price\nPaid at date of acquisition times the number of units acquired,\nminus the dollar amount of inflation in the Sale Price Received\nat date of sale if sold prior to December 3, 2001, times the\nnumber of units sold.\u201d  #5789 or 5900, Notice at V.D.1.(a).\n\u201cPurchase Price Paid\u201d is defined as \u201cthe amount paid or value of\nthe consideration given for each unit of the security.\u201d  Id. at\nV.D.  Since the amount paid or consideration given for the stock\nreceived through the 2-for-1 stock split was zero at the time of\nthe split, the \u201cPurchase Price Paid\u201d for the stock acquired is\nzero.  Because the investor paid nothing to \u201cacquire\u201d the stock\nthrough the split, he has no Recognized Loss under the Plan for\nthe acquisition of those additional shares.  Lead Counsel\nsummarizes, \u201c[R]eal economic losses are determined based on the\n\n\n- 36 -\namount paid or consideration given at the time of the stock\nacquisition.  When nothing was paid and no consideration was given\nto acquire the stock, as in the stock split, there is no\ncompensable economic loss for additional shares received.\u201d  #5951\nat 2-3.\nAlthough Mr. Ilavia reiterated his objection and other\ncomplaints in another letter, #5957, the Court finds Lead\nCounsel\u2019s explanation clear, rational, and supported by the\nlanguage of the Plan.  It is also in accord with the law.  Rose\nv. Arkansas Valley Environmental & Utility Authority, 462 F. Supp.\nat 1188-89 (a person who receives a security as a gift or through\ninheritance, but who parts with no consideration and incurs no\nliabilities in connection therewith, is not a purchaser or seller\nof the security entitled to maintain a \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5\ncause of action).  Accordingly the Court overrules Mr. Ilavia\u2019s\nobjections. \nIII.  Ruling\nHaving reviewed all submissions and heard oral arguments\nat the Fairness Hearing, made findings of fact, and addressed all\npending objections, this Court finds that the proposed Plan of\nAllocation is fair, adequate and reasonable.  Accordingly, the\nCourt\n\n\n- 37 -\nORDERS that Lead Plaintiff\u2019s motion for final approval\nof the proposed Plan of allocation of the settlement proceeds\n(instrument #5793) is GRANTED.\n  \nSIGNED at Houston, Texas, this 8th day of September,\n2008.\n________________________________\n         MELINDA HARMON\n  UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n\n"
