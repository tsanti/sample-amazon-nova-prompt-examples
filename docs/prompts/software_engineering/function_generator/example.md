### Amazon Nova Pro User Prompt
      ## Requirements ##
      Create a function called 'group_by_frequency' that takes a list of any hashable items and returns a dictionary where:
      - Keys are the frequencies (number of occurrences)
      - Values are lists of items that appear that many times
      - The items in each list should be sorted in their natural order
      - Empty input should return an empty dictionary
      For example: group_by_frequency([1,1,2,2,2,3]) should return {1: [3], 2: [1], 3: [2]}
